## Hi, my name is Aisha 


**I'm a MSc student in Forestry and part of the [Wildlife Coexistence lab](http://wildlife.forestry.ubc.ca)** :evergreen_tree: :whale2: :herb: :leopard: :palm_tree: :elephant: :deciduous_tree: :beetle: :tiger2:

My research will look at the expanding dairy industry in Sri Lanka, and its potential impacts on the Sri Lankan leopard *(Panthera pardus kotiya)* given the ongoing habitat destruction and fragmentation, changing prey dynamics and likelihood of increased carnivore-livestock conflict. I hope to explore cattle husbandry methods which are cheap, easy and practical to implement in order to guide the dairy industry towards developing in coexistence with existing wildlife, and not to sacrifice them.

#### This is Kaaya, my super-mutt of a dog :wolf:

She was adopted from Prince Albert National Park in northern Saskatchewan, and turned out to be pregnant! She was an awesome mum and regularly visits her pups. 

#### Other things I like apart from dogs: 

- Hikes 
- Wildlife

#### Reporting my process

This is my first time using R, Git, Github etc. so it's a steep learning curve. I made changes to this README.md file using R, editing locally, then saving, committing and pushing to Github. For the R Markdown document I went through what we learned in class, and made some slight changes to explore other tools and processes I could do in R.

Issues I had were making the images smaller in size when linking to an image online (which I still can't figure out how to do) and isolating a country out of the gapminder data - I tried to look at just Chile but errors kept coming up. Finally figured it out!
